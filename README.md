# Calculator (Java Console Program)

## Overview
This is a simple *Java-based calculator* built for console input/output. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations as well as exponentiation.  
The program uses a do-while loop to repeat calculations until the user chooses to exit.

## Features
- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)  
    - Includes a check to prevent division by zero
  - Exponentiation (^)
- User-friendly prompts for input
- Repeats calculations until the user types n or N

## How It Works
1. User enters the first number.
2. User enters an operator (+, -, *, /, ^).
3. User enters the second number.
4. The program performs the calculation and shows the result.
5. The user is asked if they want to perform another calculation.
6. If the user enters y or Y, the process repeats; otherwise, the program exits.

## Example Usage

CALCULATOR
Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, ^, ): *
Enter the second number: 5

The answer is 50.0
Another Calculation..?(y/n): y

CALCULATOR
Enter the first number: 2
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /, ^, ): ^
Enter the second number: 3

The answer is 8.0
Another Calculation..?(y/n): n


## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a file named *Calculator.java*.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the fileâ€™s directory.
